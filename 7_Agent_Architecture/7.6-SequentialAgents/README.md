## Architecture

```
User Query ‚Üí Guardrail Agent ‚Üí Research/Outreach Detection
                ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
    Normal Conversation              Sequential Research Flow
            ‚Üì                               ‚Üì
    Fallback Agent           Research ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí Email Draft
```

### Sequential Research Flow:
1. **Guardrail Agent**: Detects research/outreach requests vs normal conversation (lightweight, fast)
2. **Research Agent**: Performs comprehensive web research using Brave Search API
3. **Enrichment Agent**: Fills gaps in research data (location, company details, education, etc.)
4. **Email Draft Agent**: Creates professional outreach emails and saves to Gmail drafts
5. **Fallback Agent**: Handles normal conversational requests

### Conversation History Strategy:
- **Intermediate Agents**: Stream responses to user but don't update conversation history
- **Final Agents**: Only email draft and fallback agents update conversation history
- **State Flow**: Each agent adds its summary to state for the next agent to use

### Cost Optimization Strategy:
- **Minimal Guardrail Dependencies**: Guardrail agent uses only session ID for fast decisions
- **Sequential Execution**: Agents execute in order, each building on previous results
- **Streaming with Fallback**: Reduces latency while maintaining reliability
- **Efficient State Flow**: LangGraph manages state transitions efficiently

"Find information about Sarah Smith at Microsoft and create an email draft"
"Look up details about ABC Company and write a business development email"
"Research the CEO of XYZ startup and draft a partnership proposal"
```

**Normal Conversation:**
```
"How are you today?"
"What's the weather like?"
"Explain machine learning to me"
"Help me understand this concept"
```


## Sequential Workflow Logic

The guardrail agent analyzes queries and routes to:

### Research/Outreach Flow (`research_request`)
Triggers the complete sequential workflow for requests involving:
- Researching people or companies
- Creating professional outreach emails
- Lead research and business development
- **Example**: "Research John Doe at TechCorp and draft an outreach email"

**Sequential Steps:**
1. **Research Agent**: Gathers initial information using Brave Search
2. **Enrichment Agent**: Fills data gaps (location, company details, education)
3. **Email Draft Agent**: Creates professional email and saves to Gmail drafts

### Normal Conversation (`conversation`)
Routes directly to fallback agent for:
- General assistant queries
- Casual conversation
- System help and guidance
- **Example**: "How are you today?"

## Response Format

All interfaces return responses with sequential workflow metadata:

```json
{
  "text": "I've completed research on John Doe and created a professional email draft...",
  "session_id": "session789",
  "is_research_request": true,
  "routing_reason": "This is a research and outreach request",
  "research_summary": "John Doe is a Senior Engineer at TechCorp...",
  "enrichment_summary": "Additional research found he graduated from Stanford...",
  "email_draft_created": true,
  "agent_type": "email_draft",
  "complete": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and virtual environment is activated
2. **Environment Variables**: Check `.env` file configuration
3. **Supabase Connection**: Verify Supabase credentials and connection
4. **Brave API**: Verify Brave Search API key is valid
5. **Gmail Setup**: Ensure OAuth2 credentials and compose/send scope configuration
6. **Port Conflicts**: Default port is 8040 for the API server

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Workflow Issues

Check guardrail routing decisions:
- **Research Requests**: Should include research + email creation intent
- **Normal Conversation**: General questions, explanations, casual chat
- **State Flow**: Verify research data passes correctly between agents
- **Email Creation**: Check Gmail credentials and permissions

### Common Workflow Patterns

**Successful Research Flow:**
1. Guardrail detects research intent ‚Üí `is_research_request: true`
2. Research agent gathers initial data ‚Üí `research_summary` populated
3. Enrichment agent fills gaps ‚Üí `enrichment_summary` populated  
4. Email draft agent creates email ‚Üí `email_draft_created: true`

**Conversation Flow:**
1. Guardrail detects conversation ‚Üí `is_research_request: false`
2. Routes directly to fallback agent ‚Üí `agent_type: "fallback"`

### Rate Limiting & API Usage

**Brave Search API:**
- Built-in 1-second delay between API calls to prevent quota issues
- Research flow makes 2 sequential API calls (research + enrichment)
- Rate limiting helps avoid 429 errors during sequential execution

## Cost Optimization Notes

- **Guardrail Efficiency**: Uses smaller model for fast routing decisions
- **Sequential Execution**: Each agent builds on previous results, no redundant work
- **Streaming Strategy**: Reduce perceived latency with real-time responses
- **State Management**: Efficient data flow between agents without redundant API calls

This architecture provides both cost efficiency and comprehensive research capabilities by executing agents sequentially with intelligent state management.

## Examples

### Research & Outreach Example

**Input:**
```
"Research Sarah Chen at DataFlow Inc and draft a partnership email"
```

**Workflow:**
1. **Guardrail**: Detects research + email intent
2. **Research**: Finds Sarah's role, company background, recent news
3. **Enrichment**: Discovers education, location, recent achievements
4. **Email Draft**: Creates personalized outreach email saved to Gmail drafts

**Output:**
```
‚úâÔ∏è I've researched Sarah Chen at DataFlow Inc and created a professional outreach email draft in your Gmail drafts folder.

Research Summary: Sarah Chen is the VP of Engineering at DataFlow Inc, a fast-growing data analytics startup...

Enrichment Data: Additional research shows she graduated from MIT with a CS degree and recently spoke at the Data Summit 2024...

Email Draft: A personalized partnership proposal highlighting relevant synergies has been created and saved to your Gmail drafts.
```

### Conversation Example

**Input:**
```
"How does machine learning work?"
```

**Workflow:**
1. **Guardrail**: Detects conversation intent
2. **Fallback**: Provides educational explanation

**Output:**
```
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed...
```

This system optimizes for professional research and outreach automation while maintaining natural conversation capabilities.
