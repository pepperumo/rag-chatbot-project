# Module 6: Production-Ready Agent Deployment - Master Plan

## Project Overview

Module 6 transforms the AI agent system from a development prototype into a production-ready deployment with enterprise-grade containers, automated testing, and flexible deployment options. This module restructures and enhances the agent API, RAG pipeline, and frontend for scalable cloud deployment.

## Architecture Evolution

### From Development to Production

**Previous State (Modules 4-5):**
- Individual components running separately
- Manual configuration and deployment
- Development-focused RAG pipeline (continuous only)
- No containerization or automated testing

**Module 6 Target State:**
- Fully containerized microservices architecture
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing
- Flexible RAG pipeline (continuous + scheduled job modes)
- Production-ready deployment configurations
- Enhanced observability and monitoring

### Core Components

```

â”œâ”€â”€ backend_agent_api/      # FastAPI agent with Pydantic AI
â”œâ”€â”€ backend_rag_pipeline/   # Document processing with dual modes
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/               # React application with auth
â”œâ”€â”€ sql/                    # Database schemas + state management
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml      # Orchestrated local deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy.py               # Script to help with cloud or local deployments
â””â”€â”€ ../.github/workflows/      # CI/CD automation (NEW - one directory up at the root of the repo)
```

## Key Innovations for Module 6

### 1. **Unified RAG Pipeline Architecture**
- **Dual Execution Modes**: Continuous service OR scheduled job
- **Environment Variable Control**: Single `RUN_MODE` switches behavior
- **Database State Management**: Persistent state across container restarts
- **Service Account Authentication**: Cloud-native Google Drive access

### 2. **Production Containerization**
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** for optimized image sizes
- **Security hardening** with non-root users and minimal attack surface
- **Health checks** and proper signal handling
- **Environment-driven configuration** for deployment flexibility

### 3. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **Playwright E2E tests** for frontend user workflows
- **Container testing** for deployment validation

### 4. **DevOps Automation**
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** with automated testing and deployment
- **Code quality gates** with linting and security analysis
- **Multi-platform deployment** (local, cloud, scheduled jobs)
